          Are you a pilot tester?  You can create a new record using a simple web form.  Just select this button to get started.
          %div.pad_above

              %li.list-group-item You'll be asked to provide basic information about a book: it's title, author, publication information, how many pages, and what it's about.
              %li.list-group-item You won't need to know all of those details to get started: the only required field in a record is the title.
              %li.list-group-item If there is an error in the information entered in the form, don't worry, you'll see the record after you create it and can fix it.
              %li.list-group-item And a cataloger will review the information after the record is created, and can resolve any remaining issues then.
